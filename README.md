# 💫 About Me:
# 👋 Hello, I'm Alex Waweru

I'm a Data Scientist with 4+ years of experience in transforming complex data into actionable insights. I hold a BSc in Applied Statistics with Computing, which has provided me with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and algorithm engineering for automation.

💻 I specialize in:
- **Python** for advanced ML/DL model development
- **R** for statistical computing and exploratory data analysis
- **SQL** for database querying and data pipeline design
- **Power BI** for creating dynamic, interactive dashboards

🚀 I'm currently expanding my skills in:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Agentic AI frameworks** (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph)

🛠️ Recent Projects:
I'm developing an AI-powered **Energy Management System** to automate financial modeling, dispatch analysis, and revenue tracking for power plants—delivering real-time analytics to optimize operations.

📈 My passion lies at the intersection of data science and strategy building solutions that are both technically robust and business-driven.

Let's collaborate on projects that drive innovation with AI and data!
